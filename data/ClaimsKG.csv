The breads were consumed in the context of a standard breakfast (10 g protein, 14 g fat) containing 75 g of available carbohydrates (50 g starch from bread, 25 g sugars from jam).

The AX-rich fibre contained 70 % NSPs by weight, with a soluble:total NSP ratio of 0.62, an AX:total NSP ratio of 0.90 and an arabinose:xylose ratio of 0.60. Blood glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 min after each breakfast. A repeated-measures general linear model using time, meal type, and time and meal type interaction as within-subject factors was used to compare the effects of breakfast meals containing different amounts of AX-rich fibre at different time points over 2 h post-prandial. Differences in incremental areas under the curve (iAUCs) for glucose and insulin responses, as well as dose-response relationships, were also assessed. Fasting plasma glucose did not differ between the three interventions. Blood glucose concentrations peaked at 30 min after consumption of the meals, and peak post-prandial glucose concentrations after the meals containing 6 and 12 g of AX-rich fibre were significantly lower than after the control meal (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). No significant differences were observed between meals containing 6 and 12 g of AX-rich fibre. Fasting plasma insulin did not differ between the three interventions and insulin concentrations peaked at 30 min after consumption of the three meals. Differences in blood insulin concentrations did not differ significantly between meals except for the 12 g of AX-rich fibre vs. the control meal at 45 min postprandial (p<0.001). The iAUC for glucose was significantly lower during the 6 g AX-rich fibre meal than during the control meal (-20.2 %, p<0.05), and significantly lower during the 12 g AX-rich fibre meal than during the 6 g AX-rich fibre meal (p<0.05) and the control meal (-41.4 %, p<0.01).

(1991) was an eight-week, open-label, cross-over intervention in which 41 adult men (29-79 years) with mild hypercholesterolaemia were randomised to consume daily either 12 prunes (~100 g; ~6 g dietary fibre by analysis) or 360 ml grape juice (low-fibre control) for four weeks each in order to assess the effects of prunes on blood cholesterol concentrations. Biochemical parameters and 72-h faecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of each intervention period. There were no drop-outs. Treatment differences were assessed by repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) grouped by diet sequence. The baseline and prune periods were compared with the grape juice period. Faecal wet and dry weights were significantly higher after the prune period than after the grape juice period (faecal wet weight as g/72 h (mean±SEM): 628±44 vs. 514±34, respectively p=0.001; faecal dry weight as g/72 h: 140±9 vs. 120±8, respectively, p=0.006) and higher than baseline values (faecal wet weight as g/72 h (mean±SEM): 550±42.7; faecal dry weight as g/72h: 123±7.1).

The Panel considers that this study shows an effect of dried plums on bowel function as indicated by increased faecal weight.",Tinker et al. (1991): 10.1093/ajcn/53.5.1259,"Attaluri et al. (2011) described an eight-week cross-over study with blinded data analysis. Forty chronically constipated subjects (m/f=3/37, mean age 38 years) were recruited from the community. Subjects were instructed to maintain their usual lifestyle including diet and physical activity. Laxatives and other remedies for constipation were discontinued for at least one week prior to study enrolment. Subjects were randomised to consume dried plums (50 g twice daily with meals (about12 plums daily), equivalent to about 6 g per day of fibre) or psyllium (11 g twice daily with 240 ml of water, equivalent to 6 g per day of fibre) for three weeks each, with a wash-out period of one week in between, after a one-week run-in. Subjects were then followed for six weeks (no intervention), during which they were asked to continue with their usual diets and remedies to treat constipation. They were asked to maintain a daily stool and symptom diary during the eight-week study period and during the last week of the six-week follow up. At the end of each intervention period, subjects were asked to fill in a global constipation symptom score (a validated Rome III outcome measure). Rules for the use of rescue laxatives were defined and their use documented in the stool diaries. There were no drop-outs in the study. The investigators who analysed the data were blinded to treatment group allocation. The primary outcome measure of the study, which was used for power calculations, was the mean number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs, defined as bowel movements with sensation of complete evacuation and with no laxative/enema in the preceding 24 h) per week. Secondary outcomes were global constipation symptom scores, taste survey scores, stool consistency (Bristol stool form scale), and straining scores. In addition, the number of bowel movements per week, the number of spontaneous bowel movements (no laxative/enema in the preceding 24 h) per week, and the number of complete bowel movements (sensation of complete evacuation) per week were also assessed from the stool diaries. One-week measurements obtained at baseline, during the third week of each intervention period, and at the end of follow-up were compared using two-tailed paired Student‟s t-test with Welch‟s correction for unequal variances and one-way analysis of variance. Negative binomial regression analysis was used to assess carry-over effects for primary and secondary outcome variables. No carry-over effects were identified for primary or secondary outcomes. The Panel notes that the statistical analysis performed was not appropriate for assessing differences between the two interventions, i.e. dried plums and psyllium. As compared to pre-intervention baselines, the intervention with either dried plums or psyllium resulted in a significant increase in mean CSBMs per week (1.8 vs. 3.5, p=0.001 and 1.6 vs. 2.8, p=0.001, respectively). For both interventions, CSBM-per-week values returned to pre-treatment baseline during the wash-out period. Significant changes with the dried plum intervention in some of the secondary outcome measures such as stool consistency and improved straining scores as compared to baseline are in line with the observed effect on bowel movements. The Panel notes that dried plums showed an effect on bowel function similar to psyllium, for which there is evidence to support a laxative effect (Brandt et al., 2005; Fleming and Wade, 2010; Ramkumar and Rao, 2005). The Panel considers that this study shows an effect of dried plums on bowel function. ",Attaluri et al. (2011): 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2011.04594.x,"A cross-over study (Howarth et al., 2010) was designed to investigate the effect of different snacks on energy and nutrient intake, as well as their impact on body weight and bowel habits. A total of 29 females (25 to 54 years) were randomised to consume twice daily one 100 kcal snack of either prunes (84 g/day, number of plums not indicated; 6 g/day dietary fibre) or low-fat cookies (1 g/day dietary fibre) for two weeks each, with a two-week wash-out period in between after a three day baseline run-in. The primary outcome of the study (used for power calculations) was differences in energy intake between snack types. Intake of macronutrients, intake of dietary fibre, changes in body weight, and changes in bowel habits were secondary outcomes. Dietary intake (via food records) was assessed at baseline and every other day for a total of seven days per treatment period. Information on bowel habits (via a self-reported seven-day bowel habit questionnaire) was collected at baseline and daily during the second week of each treatment period. Bowel habit parameters included stool consistency, straining during bowel movement, pain during bowel movement, completeness of evacuation, overall feeling of constipation, and stool frequency. Mean stool frequency in this population sub-group was normal (around 1.2 per day). Twenty-six women completed the study and entered data analysis, which was performed in the population of completers only. Differences in dietary intake and bowel habits between baseline and the interventions were assessed by RMANOVA with post hoc paired-comparison t-tests. Subjects reported significantly softer stools with dried plum consumption compared to low-fat cookie intake and baseline values (p≤0.05). No other significant decreases were reported for any other bowel habit parameter. The Panel notes that this study had a number of limitations, for example, self-reported outcomes are not a sensitive measure of changes in bowel function in this group which had normal bowel function, and the information provided was insufficient to judge the appropriateness of the statistical analyses. The Panel considers that this study with considerable limitations showed an effect of dried plums on stool consistency but not on other measures of bowel function",Howart et al. (2010): 10.1016/j.jada.2010.006.002,"Several references which proposed mechanisms by which some components of prunes could contribute to the claimed effect were identified (Couteau et al., 2001; Livesey, 2001; Parkar et al., 2008; Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis et al., 2001; Welsch et al., 1989). Prunes contain dietary fibre, both soluble and insoluble, and sorbitol (Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis et al., 2001). Insoluble components of dietary fibre resist breakdown by the microflora and exert a physical effect on faecal bulk by their presence, and by retaining water within the cellular structure, whereas the soluble components are extensively degraded by the microflora resulting in a substantial stimulation of microbial growth and thereby an increased faecal bulk (Cummings, 2001). Increased faecal mass will increase the diameter of the lumen of the colon, thereby decreasing intraluminal pressure and allowing increased forward flow of the faeces (Gregory and Strong, 2005). Sorbitol is poorly absorbed in the small intestine and acts as an osmotic laxative (Livesey, 2001; Mahan and Escott-Stump, 2007; US Food and Drug Administration, 1993). While individual variation is observed with regard to the laxative threshold for sorbitol, laxative effects have regularly been observed with a dose of 20 g and more, and in some studies with a dose of 5-10 g (Badiga et al., 1990; Bauditz et al., 2008; Hyams, 1983; Jain et al., 1985). The Panel considers that there is good evidence for plausible mechanisms by which some components of prunes (i.e. sorbitol and dietary fibre) may contribute to an improvement in bowel function",Couteau et al.

(about 10-12 plums, 7 g dietary fibre) or 75 g of dried apples (6.5 g dietary fibre) daily for three months. Subjects were asked to fill in a validated questionnaire regarding their weekly bowel habits, including stool frequency, estimated faecal bulk, consistency of stool (7-point scale), strain and pain during bowel movement, and feeling of constipation after bowel movement. Mean stool frequency in this population sub-group was normal (around 11 per week). Data were analysed by RM-ANOVA. Thirty-eight women completed the study.

Folate deficiency has been shown to reduce proliferation of various cell types. Cells lacking folate accumulate in the S-phase owing to nucleotide imbalance and slow DNA synthesis; such cells also have increased uracil misincorporation and DNA damage. When folate is added back to folate-deficient cells, there is a reversal of the S-phase accumulation, and proliferation is restored. Folate deficiency has been shown to reduce the proportion of circulating T lymphocytes and their proliferation in response to mitogen activation. In addition, folate deficiency induced in PHAactivated human T lymphocytes induced apoptosis and increased the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells because of a marked reduction in CD8+ cell proliferation. All these effects were reversible in vitro by either folate addition or nucleotide repletion, and suggest that folate status may affect the immune system by inhibiting the capacity of CD8+ T lymphocyte cells to proliferate in response to mitogen activation (Courtemanche et al., 2004).

Other non-haem iron containing enzymes are also involved in the electron transport chain. These are for example cytochrome c reductase, NADH-dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase which are involved in energy-yielding metabolism (Elmadfa and Leitzmann, 1988). Impaired oxygen transport caused by anaemia exerts an indirect effect on the electron transport chain where oxygen acts as electron acceptor (Koolman and Röhm, 1994). It is difficult to determine whether any particular functional abnormality caused by iron deficiency is a specific consequence of the anaemia per se and impaired oxygen delivery or the result of iron deficiency in tissues.

(1988) investigated breath hydrogen concentration (BHC) after ingestion of lactose in water, milk, fresh or heated yoghurt by 26 healthy, young adults with or without lactose maldigestion. The fresh yoghurt contained 3 x 108 CFU/g S. thermophilus and 3 x 108 CFU/g L. bulgaricus. The total amount of lactose ingested with each product was 18 g. Ingestion of fresh yoghurt reduced BHC significantly (p<0.001) compared to lactose or milk, whereas after ingestion of heated yoghurt BHC was higher (p<0.01) compared to fresh yoghurt. The double-blind study by Lerebours et al. (1989) evaluated lactose digestion (using BHC) after short-term (24 h) or prolonged (8 day) ingestion of yoghurt and fermented-then-pasteurised milk (FPM) by 16 lactase-deficient subjects. Consumption of yoghurt (125 g three times per day) enhanced lactose digestion (18 g lactose in yoghurt) and this effect was destroyed by pasteurisation. Similar results were obtained in both study periods and no adaptation of lactase activity was observed in longterm ingestion of yoghurt.",Dewit et al. (1988): link; Lerebours et al. (1989): 10.1093/ajcn/49.5.823,"Marteau et al. (1990) measured BHC in eight lactase-deficient volunteers who ingested 18 g of lactose in the form of milk (400 mL whole milk per day), yoghurt (450 g per day) and heated yoghurt (450 g per day) for three consecutive days. Total BHC was significantly lower after consumption of yoghurt and heated yoghurt compared with milk consumption (p<0.001). Significantly less lactose was recovered from the terminal ileum after yoghurt than after heated yoghurt meals (p<0.05), and approximately one-fifth of the lactase activity contained in yoghurt reached the terminal ileum. Varela-Moreiras et al. (1992) evaluated lactose maldigestion after ingestion of three dairy products by 53 healthy institutionalised elderly people; 36 % of them were found to be lactose maldigesters using the BHC test. The effect of consuming an equivalent amount of lactose (11 g lactose in 200 mL of product) contained in yoghurt and fermented-then-pasteurised milk (FPM) was assessed in these subjects. BHC was significantly higher after ingestion of milk than after ingestion of yoghurt (p<0.05). This effect was partially eliminated when FPM was tested. Moreover, BHC was significantly higher three hours after ingestion of FPM compared to normal yoghurt (p< 0.05).",Marteau et al. (1990): 10.1079/bjn19900010; Varela-Moreiras et al. (1992): PMID 1578093,"In the study of Rizkalla et al. (2000), two groups of 12 healthy men with or without lactose maldigestion were recruited using the BHC test with a 30 g lactose load. Subjects were randomly assigned in a cross-over design to 500 g per day of either fresh or heat-treated yoghurt for two periods of 15 days each, separated by a 15 days washout interval. In subjects with lactose maldigestion, BHC values were significantly lower after consumption of fresh compared to heat-treated yoghurt consumption (p<0.01). In the double-blind, cross-over designed study of Labayen et al. (2001), 22 lactose maldigesters received daily 25 g of lactose in fresh yoghurt (live yoghurt bacteria >108 CFU/g) or heat-treated yoghurt (<102 CFU/g) for 15 days, followed by a cross-over (15 days) after a wash-out period (14 days). The test dose was 500 mL per day for both products. The BHC test indicated more effective lactose digestion after fresh yoghurt intake as compared to heat-treated yoghurt. The orocaecal transit time (OCTT) was shorter after heated yoghurt ingestion as compared with fresh yoghurt and there were less severe gastrointestinal symptoms (p< 0.05) after fresh yoghurt intake.",Rizkalla et al.

(2001) assessed in a double-blind, randomised cross-over study the effects of ingestion of milk, yoghurt (108 CFU/mL), heat-treated (70 °C, 30 sec) yoghurt (<15 CFU/mL) and two products obtained by dilution of yoghurt with heat-treated product (106 and 105 CFU/mL) on hydrogen production and symptoms of lactose intolerance in 24 male lactose maldigesters. Hydrogen production and adverse events were followed during eight hours after ingestion of a single dose of each test product. The volume of each serving was not indicated. At each test, subjects received 25 g lactose in one of the products. Ingestion of yoghurt with 108 CFU/mL led to significantly lower BHC values (p<0,001 for AUCi (incremental area under curve, p=0.036 for Cmax maximal hydrogen concentration variation)) and a reduced number of complaints compared to the other products. Kolars et al. (1984) used the BHC test to determine in 10 lactose-intolerant subjects (20 to 28 years of age) whether lactase-deficient subjects digested lactose better in yoghurt than in milk. Breath samples were obtained in the fasting state and hourly for eight hours after ingestion of the following test meals: lactulose (10 g in 200 mL of water), lactose (20 g in 400 mL of water), milk (400 mL containing 18 g of lactose) and commercial unflavoured yoghurt (440 g containing 18 g of lactose, and 270 g containing 11 g of lactose, respectively). Ingestion of 440 g of test yoghurt resulted in only about one third as much hydrogen excretion as a similar load of lactose in milk or water. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.01). In case of lactulose, the increase in breath hydrogen was comparable to that obtained with lactose. The symptoms reported by the subjects after ingestion of test meals supported the perception that lactose was digested better in yoghurt than in milk; 80 per cent of the subjects ingesting milk versus 20 per cent of those ingesting yoghurt reported diarrhoea or flatulence",Pelletier et al.

(1989) evaluated lactose digestion after intake of commercial plain yoghurt, sweet acidophilus milk, hydrolysed-lactose milk, a lactase tablet, and whole milk by 10 lactose-intolerant subjects. In a 5 x 5 Latin square design, BHC was measured for five hours after the subjects had consumed one of the products (totally 18 g lactose in each except lactose-hydrolysed milk, which provided 5 g). The products were consumed in a single dose (volume was not indicated) in five periods at five weekly intervals. Mean BHC values (ppm) were significantly (p<0.05) lower for yoghurt than for sweet acidophilus milk and whole milk. With regard to alleviating symptoms of lactose maldigestion, yoghurt was as effective as lactose-hydrolysed milk, but was significantly (p<0.05) more effective than commercial lactase consumed along with milk. Shermak et al. (1995) compared symptoms of lactose maldigestion and breath hydrogen production after typical servings of milk, heat-treated yoghurt (85 °C, 30 min), and yoghurt containing live bacteria ingested by 14 lactose-maldigesting children (mean age 9.5 years). Symptoms and BHC values were recorded for eight hours after ingestion of 12 g lactose served in milk and yoghurts. Live yoghurt contained 1.6 x 108 CFU/g of both yoghurt cultures and the pasteurised yoghurt contained 2.5 x 103 CFU/g of both cultures. Lactose-maldigesting children experienced significantly fewer symptoms after consuming yoghurt with live cultures than after intake of milk (p<0.005). Pasteurised yoghurt showed an intermediate effect. Lactose from yoghurt was not better digested than lactose from milk, as indicated by similar areas under the hydrogen curve in the BHC test. However, yoghurt was associated with a delayed time to rise and lower rate of rise of the hydrogen concentration in the breath.",Onwulata et al. (1989): 10.1093/ajcn/49.6.1233; Shermak et al.

(1992) compared the efficiency of lactose digestion after consumption of two unmodified plain yoghurts, a low-fat yoghurt and a yoghurt produced from lactose-hydrolysed milk by assessing BHC in 14 lactose-maldigesters. Compared to whole milk, the hydrogen breath response to two varieties of unmodified yoghurt and the lactose-hydrolysed yoghurt was significantly (p<0.05) attenuated while the hydrogen response to low-fat yoghurt was intermediate. Intolerance symptoms were significantly (p<0.05) and equally reduced (50 %, p<0.05) with all four yoghurt products compared to whole milk. ",Rosado et al.

In addition, Drouault et al. (2002) applied a bacterial luciferase to monitor gene expression of Streptococcus thermophilus in the digestive tract of germ-free mice. The main result was that the bacterium was able to produce active β-galactosidase enzyme in the digestive tract, although the bacterium did not multiply during gastrointestinal transit.

Fourteen studies, which compared the effect of melatonin administered before bedtime (n=218 subjects) vs. placebo (n=207 subjects), met the inclusion criteria. Eleven studies had a cross-over design. The studies were conducted in children (2 studies), adults aged 19-65 (7 studies), and adults aged 66 years and older (5 studies).

Twelve of the 17 studies included in the meta-analysis provided measures of sleep onset latency. Six studies were conducted on healthy volunteers, four on subjects with insomnia, one on both healthy volunteers and insomniacs, and one on a combination of institutionalised and free-living subjects with insomnia. Sample size ranged from 6 to 30 subjects, all studies had a cross-over design with or without a wash-out phase, duration ranged from one night to three weeks, melatonin doses from 0.1 to 40 mg/day, and either one or multiple melatonin doses were tested in the same study.

Removing the two smallest studies (6 and 8 subjects, respectively) from the analysis, because of the presence of outliers in the data set or heterogeneity of the data, led to a reduction of sleep onset latency of 7.4 min (95 % CI -5.1, -9.8) in favour of melatonin. The Panel considers that the results of this meta-analysis can be used as evidence for the substantiation of the claim, but notes some methodological limitations, including the lack of extensive sensitivity analysis or adjustment for the different doses used in the various studies.

It is well established that the bulking effect of cereal fibre is closely related to the physico-chemical properties of the fibre, and thereby to the degree of fermentation by the gut microbiota in the large intestine. Insoluble dietary fibre is fermented to a lesser extent than soluble dietary fibre, and thereby leads to an increase in faecal bulking per se. The bulking effects of soluble dietary fibre are determined by the higher extent of fermentation, and thus an increase in the bacterial mass in faeces (bacteria contain about 80 % water) (Cummings et al., 2001). For cereal fibres, the average increase in faecal output per gram of dietary fibre consumed by humans is estimated to be 3.4 g for oat bran or oats, compared to 3.3 g for corn meal or corn bran and 5.4 g for wheat bran, and 3.5 g for cellulose (Cummings, 2001)",Cummings et al.

The phenolic composition and content of the olive oils used in this study are reported by de la Torre-Carbot et al. (2010). Oxidative damage to lipids was assessed by measuring plasma-circulating oxidised LDL (oxLDL, immunoenzymatic assay), plasma total F2α-isoprostanes (HPLC, stable isotope-dilution and MS), plasma C18 hydroxy fatty acids (GC-MS) and serum LDL cholesterol un-induced conjugated dienes. Hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol excretion in urine were measured to assess compliance. A significant linear decrease in biomarkers of lipid peroxidation (conjugated dienes, hydroxy fatty acids and oxLDL) was observed in association with the increasing phenolic content of the olive oils. oxLDL significantly increased with the low phenolic-containing olive oil, and significantly decreased with the medium and high phenolic-containing olive oils (p<0.014). No consistent change was observed in plasma total F2α-isoprostanes. The Panel notes the large sample size of this multicentre study, the sufficient characterisation of polyphenols in the olive oils used, the use of valid biomarkers to assess lipid peroxidation, and in particular the peroxidation of LDL particles, and the dose-dependent response observed between the intake of polyphenols in olive oil and the decrease in LDL peroxidation",Covas et al.

The concentrations of hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid sulphate (but not of tyrosol sulphate) in LDL particles significantly increased (p<0.05), whereas the concentration of circulating markers of lipid peroxidation, including LDL particles (oxLDL, conjugated dienes and hydroxy fatty acids), significantly decreased (p<0.05) after ingestion of olive oil with high phenolic content. The Panel notes the inverse relationship between the concentrations of phenolic metabolites in LDL particles and the degree of LDL peroxidation",Covas et al.

Urinary tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol were measured as markers of compliance. In vivo plasma oxLDL (measured by a sandwich ELISA procedure using the murine monoclonal antibody, mAb-4E6) significantly decreased (p=0.006 for linear trend), and ex vivo resistance of LDL to oxidation significantly increased (p=0.012 for linear trend) with the phenolic content of the olive oils administered. The Panel notes the use of a valid biomarker to assess LDL peroxidation (oxLDL), the inclusion of a supportive marker (ex vivo resistance of LDL to oxidation), the sufficient characterisation of polyphenols in the olive oils used, and the dose-dependent response observed between the intake of polyphenols in olive oil and the decrease in LDL peroxidation.",Marrugat et al.

Percentages of individual phenolic compounds present in the olive oil were approximately 6.5 % hydroxytyrosol, 5.5 % tyrosol, 40 % oleuropein aglycones, 26 % ligstrosid aglycones, 12 % luteolin and 3 % apigenine as measured by HPLC. Consumption of olive oils significantly decreased plasma oxidised LDL (oxLDL measured by the ELISA method) and MDA in urine (HPLC-UV), and significantly increased glutathione peroxidase activity (p<0.05 for linear trend for all) in a dosedependent manner in relation to the phenolic content of the olive oil administered, whereas plasma 8- oxo-prostaglandin F2α (HPLC and stable isotope dilution MS) was not affected. The Panel notes the use of a valid biomarker to assess LDL peroxidation (oxLDL), the sufficient characterisation of the olive oil polyphenols, and the dose-dependent response observed between the intake of polyphenols in olive oil and the decrease in LDL peroxidation",Weinbrenner et al. (2004): 10.1093/jn/134.9.2314,"A dose-dependent decrease in the amount of circulating oxidised LDL particles in vivo was also found in one small scale (n=12) acute post-prandial study (Covas et al., 2006a). The lowest daily dose of hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives (measured by HPLC) in olive oil which showed a significant effect on in vivo LDL peroxidation was 5 mg (Covas et al., 2006b). A significant decrease in relation to consumption of olive oil polyphenols was also reported for serum LDL un-induced conjugated dienes (Covas et al., 2006b; de la Torre-Carbot et al., 2010) and for ex vivo resistance of LDL to oxidation (Marrugat et al., 2004), which can be considered as supportive markers to assess peroxidation of LDL particles. The Panel also notes that a significant decrease in plasma C18 hydroxy fatty acids (Covas et al., 2006b; de la Torre-Carbot et al., 2010) and urinary MDA (Weinbrenner et al., 2004) was observed following consumption of olive oil polyphenols, but that olive oil polyphenols do not appear to have an effect on F2α-isoprostanes (Covas et al., 2006a; Covas et al., 2006b; Weinbrenner et al., 2004)",Covas et al.

This suggests that the replacement of digestible starch in carbohydrate-containing foods by RS2 from high amylose maize would decrease post-prandial glycaemic and insulinaemic responses due to the replacement of digestible carbohydrates by indigestible carbohydrates, so that the amount of available glucose contributing to glycaemia is reduced, whereas the addition of RS2 to carbohydrate-containing foods does not appear to modify the post-prandial glucose responses to digestible starch (i.e. when the amount of glycaemic carbohydrates is kept constant).

The dose of available carbohydrates linearly decreased, and the amount of resistant starch (expressed as % of total starch) significantly increased, in breads made from starches with increasing percentages of amylose. The level of RS2 needed for a significant reduction in post-prandial glucose or insulin responses was assessed. The amylose content of the starch used in acute meals needed to be at least 60 % amylose to significantly reduce the post-prandial glucose responses. This level of amylose was equivalent to a minimum intake of 11.5 g RS2 in a serving of 80 g total carbohydrates and 68 g of available carbohydrates.

A protective role of riboflavin against lipid peroxidation is provided mainly by the glutathione redox cycle (Sadler et al., 1999).

The glutathione reductase enzyme requires the riboflavin co-enzyme FAD and this enzyme is particularly sensitive to riboflavin deficiency making glutathione reductase enzyme measures most suitable for assessing riboflavin status (Hoey et al, 2009).

(2003) is based on six randomised controlled trials where subjects were instructed to replace one (usually for the weight maintenance phase) or two meals (usually for the weight loss phase) with meal replacement products as part of a conventional energy restricted diet (>800 and <1600 kcal per day) or to follow a conventional energy restricted diet providing the same calorie content with durations ranging between three and 51 months. All the studies included in the meta-analysis used commercial products for the replacement of meals, which usually contain up to 250 kcal/serving and generally comply with the characterisation described in section 1 except for a lower protein content expressed on energy basis (generally 18-25 % energy as protein). A total of almost 500 subjects with initial BMI ranging between 25 and 40 kg/m2 (average 31 kg/m2 ) of which 249 were randomised to receive meal replacements (including a small portion of subject with type 2 diabetes) where evaluated for their weight loss after 3 and 12 months respectively. The drop out rate was equivalent between groups at 3 months and significantly lower in the meal replacement group at one year. Weight loss was significant at both time points in all studies (one study including 75 subjects reported only 3-month data) for both interventions, with significantly greater weight loss in subjects receiving the meal replacement plan (about 7-8 % of initial body weight) compared to the conventional energy-restricted diet (about 3-7 % of initial body weight). When subjects with type 2 diabetes were omitted from the analyses, the weight loss difference between groups was slightly more pronounced. A random effects meta-analysis estimate indicated a significantly greater weight loss in the meal replacement group than in the conventional diet group at three months and one year (weight loss difference between groups=2.54 kg and 2.43 kg, respectively). The Panel notes that the majority of studies evaluated data on completers only (per protocol analyses), and not on the intention-to-treat population, and that the most plausible explanation for the observed effects is a better compliance with the weight reduction program in the meal replacement intervention group.",Heymsfield et al. (2003): 10.1038/sj.ijo.0802258,"The meta-analysis by Anderson et al. (2004) is based on 47 intervention studies conducted in adult obese but otherwise healthy subjects (BMI at least 30 kg/m2 at baseline) assessing the effects of mealreplacements (at least two meal replacements per day, four studies), energy restricted diets (providing>1500 kcal per day, six studies), low-energy diets (providing 800-1500 kcal per day, 10 studies), very low-calorie diets (providing up to 800 kcal per day, 19 studies), and soy diets (providing up to 800 kcal per day, eight studies) and reporting weight loss data after 24 weeks of treatment. Participants in the four studies on meal replacements were overweight and obese subjects who received at least two meal replacement servings daily as part of an energy restricted diet. All the studies included in the meta-analysis used commercial products for the replacement of meals, which usually contain up to 250 kcal/serving and generally comply with the   characterisation described in section 1 except for a lower protein content expressed on energy basis (generally 18-25 % energy as protein). They involved more than 600 subjects of both sexes (470 women and 133 men) with average BMI ranging from 28 to 34 kg/m2. Two of the studies had been included in the meta-analysis by Heymsfield et al. (2003) described above (Ditschuneit et al., 1999; Ashley et al., 2001), whereas one was published after the end date for the literature search (Bowerman et al., 2001). In these studies, women lost an average of 9.3 % of their initial weight while men lost 8.6 %. These effects were comparable to intensive lifestyle interventions including conventional energy-restricted diets with an intensity factor (integrating number of visits with a doctor, clinic visits, and class hours) three times lower. Body weight loss with meal replacements was only about 50 % of that found in populations with slightly higher BMI receiving VLCD treatments with an intensity factor four times higher.

These studies have been conducted in different parts of the world, including the European Union. Such studies are not available for adults or the elderly. However, in situ studies in adults strongly support that chewing a sugar-free gum prevents progression of demineralisation upon exposure to 10% sucrose (Kashket et al., 1989), and promotes remineralisation of artificial caries on enamel blocks worn in the mouth (Leach et al., 1989; Manning et al., 1992).

Under conditions of maximal metabolic efficiency, plasma concentration of homocysteine ranges from 4 to 10 µmol/L. Metabolic blocks in homocysteine metabolism lead to accumulation of intracellular homocysteine with subsequent export into the blood. Depending on the magnitude of the metabolic impairment, plasma homocysteine can rise to varying degrees. Hyperhomocysteinemia is also caused by B vitamin deficiencies. Deficiencies of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 lead to impaired homocysteine metabolism causing mild, moderate, or severe elevations in plasma homocysteine, depending on the severity of the deficiency, as well as the coexistence of genetic or other factors that interfere with homocysteine metabolism (Miller, 2005).",Mackey et al.

Endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIDV) was evaluated by administering 0.4 mg sublingual glyceryl trinitrate prior to the measurement, and was used as internal control. Reproducibility of measurements over one month was documented in 15 healthy volunteers. The repeatability coefficient was 5.16, and the mean SD difference between EDV values was 0.52 2.66 %. It was calculated that 19 subjects were needed to detect a mean difference in EDV of 2 %, with a type I error of 5 % and a power 90 %. A total of 20 subjects completed the study and suitable brachial artery ultrasound measurements were available for 18 subjects. Compared with the Mediterranean diet, the walnut diet significantly improved EDV (from 3.6 3.3 % to 5.9 3.3 %, a relative increase of 64 %), and significantly reduced concentrations of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is a marker of endothelial activation. EIVD and concentrations of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were not significantly different between diets. The walnut diet significantly decreased total cholesterol (-4.4±7.4 %) and LDL-cholesterol (-6.4±10.0 %) concentrations. Changes in EDV significantly correlated with changes in the total/HDL-cholesterol ratio. There was no evidence of carry-over effects between treatment periods. The Panel notes that this study provides evidence for a positive and sustainable effect of walnut consumption on endothelium-dependent vasodilation.",Ros et al.

(2010), 24 type 2 diabetic subjects aged 30-75 years on stable medication use for at least three months (17 on blood pressure-lowering medication, 13 on cholesterol-lowering medication, 10 on oral antidiabetic medication) consumed a walnut-enriched ad libitum diet, and an ad libitum diet without walnuts, for 8 weeks each in a random order with an 8-week wash-out period in between, and after a 4-week run-in period to allow for diet and weight stabilisation. During the walnut period, subjects consumed 56 g English walnuts daily. EDV was the primary outcome of the study. A stimulus-adjusted response measure was used as internal control. The sample size was determined to allow for about 20 % attrition and non-compliance, and to provide 80 % power to detect a minimal difference of 2.5 % in EDV between treatments, with a maximum allowable type I error of 5 %. A total of 96 % of subjects complied with the consumption of walnuts (defined as intake of 80 % of the assigned dose). EDV improved significantly after consumption of the walnut-enriched diet as compared with the ad libitum diet without walnuts (2.2 1.7 % vs. 1.2 1.6 %, p=0.04), whereas no significant changes between groups were observed in the stimulus-adjusted response measure. No significant differences were observed between diets with respect to changes in blood lipid profile, body weight, blood glucose control or insulin sensitivity, whereas a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure was observed in the walnut diet compared to the control diet.

Endothelium-dependent vasodilation was the primary outcome of the study. A total of 12 healthy subjects and 12 subjects with hypercholesterolaemia who received no pharmacological treatment were randomised to two high-fat meal sequences (separated by one week) to which 25 g olive oil or 40 g walnuts had been added.

Flow-independent dilation and plasma ADMA concentrations were unchanged, and concentrations of oxidised low-density lipoproteins decreased (p=0.051) after both meals. The plasma concentrations of soluble inflammatory cytokines, and of adhesion molecules, decreased (p<0.01) independently of meal type, except for E-selectin, which decreased significantly more after the walnut meal.

The storage capacity is limited, in total to around 500 g for a typical adult person, of which 300 to 400 g can be stored in the muscles. While liver glycogen is essential for liver functions, and is used to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations between meals, muscle glycogen is used primarily as a source of energy within the muscles (EFSA NDA Panel, 2010). It is also well established that strenuous exercise depletes skeletal muscle glycogen stores, that low glycogen stores limit energy production in muscles and limit skeletal muscle contraction, and that glycaemic carbohydrates, consumed especially in the first hours following strenuous exercise, stimulate glycogen re-synthesis in muscle and contribute to the replenishment of skeletal muscle glycogen stores to a greater extent than other energy-containing macronutrients, and which leads to the recovery of normal skeletal muscle function (contraction) (Bergström et al., 1967; Costill et al., 1981; Burke et al., 1996; SCF, 2001; Jentjens and Jeukendrup, 2003; Rodriguez et al., 2009; Ortenbland et al., 2013).

Specifically, 1 kg-load was added every one (lower extremity) or two (upper extremity) repetitions that exceeded the 15 repetitions of the second set of each exercise. The training volume was progressively increased throughout the training programme.

The Panel indicated that ingestion of creatine, which is readily absorbed, at the doses proposed by the applicant (i.e. 3 g/day), increases the intramyocellular content of CrP pool which can enhance the rate by which ATP may be regenerated after intense muscle contractions. The Panel also indicated that the combination of creatine consumption with resistance training appears to increase the normal physiological adaptations to a training program, which include increased muscle strength. Increase in muscle strength may be the result of an improved ability to perform high-intensity exercise via increased CrP availability (Terjung et al., 2000; SCF, 2001; Buford et al., 2007).",EFSA NDA Panel (2011): 10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2303; Terjung et al.

Under these conditions, creatine consumption improves the muscle’s ability to train at higher intensities and this leads to higher muscle strength. In addition, considering the short half-life of creatine in plasma (1–2 h) and the limited rate at which creatine can be incorporated to the myocellular CrP pool, it is plausible that maintenance of a high CrP pool requires daily creatine consumption. This is supported by the fact that, in the studies where creatine was provided on training days only (three times per week) (Carter et al., 2005; Candow et al., 2008; Bemben et al., 2010; Cooke et al., 2014), no additional effect of creatine was observed on muscle strength, even if the creatine doses on a weekly basis were comparable to the studies in which creatine was consumed daily.

Wet and dry faecal weights during consumption of sugar beet fibre were significantly higher than during the run-in (self-selected diet) period (mean±SEM; wet faecal weight: 276±10 g/d vs. 198±10 g/d, p<0.0001; dry faecal weight: 67±2 g/d vs. 49±2 g/d, p<0.0001, respectively). No significant differences were reported in relation to wet faecal weight between the sugar beet and wheat fibres, whereas dry faecal weight was significantly higher in the sugar beet fibre period than in the wheat fibre period (67±2 g/d vs. 57±2 g/d, p<0.001). The Panel notes that wheat fibre has an established role in increasing faecal bulk in humans (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products Nutrition and Allergies, 2010). The Panel considers that this study shows an effect of sugar beet fibre on increasing faecal bulk.",Lampe et al. (1993): PMID 8404790,"In a randomised study with Latin-square design (3x3), nine healthy men (mean age 21.5 years) consumed either a control diet (22 g/d dietary fibre) or the same control diet supplemented with 50 g/d of either sugar beet fibre or inulin from chicory for 28 days each (Castiglia-Delavaud et al., 1998). Each experimental period comprised 2 days (days 1 and 2) with the control diet, 14 days (days 3–16) with a progressive adaptation to the intervention up to a maximum of 50 g/d; and 12 days (days 17-28) with a constant maximum intake of fibre. Diets were partially controlled (lunch and dinner were provided by the nutrition laboratory). Primary outcomes of the study were metabolisable energy and net metabolisable energy of the diets. Secondary outcomes were energy expenditure, faecal weight, frequency of defecations and faecal bacterial mass. The Panel notes that faecal weight was a secondary endpoint of the study. Comparisons between experimental diets were performed by ANOVA using the general linear models procedure according to a Latin-square design with three repetitions. Wet and dry faecal weights during consumption of sugar beet fibre were significantly higher than during the control diet (mean±SEM; wet faecal weight: 202±16 g/d vs. 129±16 g/d, p<0.05; dry faecal weight: 37.6±2.3 g/d vs. 27.7±2.3 g/d, p<0.05, respectively). Also mean faecal bacterial weight (presented as dry matter) was significantly higher in sugar beet fibre group in comparison to the control diet (20.3±1.2 g/d vs. 13.0±1.2 g/d, p<0.01). No significant differences were reported in relation to wet or dry faecal weights between the sugar beet and inulin fibres. The Panel considers that this study shows an effect of sugar beet fibre on increasing faecal bulk",Castiglia-Delavaud et al. (1998): 10.1079/096582198388292,"The applicant also provided three animal studies on the effects of sugar beet fibre on faecal bulk. In two of these studies, addition of sugar beet fibre (100 g/kg feed) to the usual diet (Nyman and Asp, 1982) or to a fibre-free diet (Johnson et al. 1990) induced a significant increase in faecal wet and dry weights in rats. In the third study (Klopfenstein,1990), coarse and fine sugar beet fibre fed at different doses (5, 7.5, and 10 % of the diet) induced a dose-response increase in wet and dry faecal weight which was apparently independent of particle size. The Panel considers that the evidence provided by these three animal studies supports an effect of sugar beet fibre on increasing faecal bulk.",Nyman and Asp (1982): 10.1079/BJN1980047; Johnson et al. (1990): 10.1079/BJN19900020; Klopfenstein (1990): ISSN 009-0352,"The mechanisms by which components of sugar beet fibre exert the claimed effect have been established. The insoluble components of fibre increase faecal bulk by absorbing water in the large intestine. The soluble components are fermented by bacteria in the large intestine leading to an increase in bacterial mass (Stephen and Cummings, 1980; Chen et al., 1998).",Stephen and Cummings (1980): 10.1038/284283a0; Chen et al.
