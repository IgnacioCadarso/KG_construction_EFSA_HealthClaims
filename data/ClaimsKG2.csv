(2007) included 29 RCTs with a total of 63,897 participants (92% women) which investigated whether calcium (16 trials, 6,517 subjects, calcium supplement 500-1600 mg/d in addition to diet), or calcium in combination with vitamin D (13 trials, 46,108 subjects, calcium supplement 200-1200 mg/d and vitamin D supplement 200- 800 IU in addition to diet), had an effect in the prevention of bone fracture and osteoporotic bone loss in subjects aged 50 years and older. When the trials reporting on bone fractures were considered (17 trials, 52,625 subjects), treatment with calcium (calcium supplement 750-1600 mg/d in addition to diet) or with calcium plus vitamin D (calcium supplement 500- 1,200 mg/d and vitamin D supplement 400-800 IU in addition to diet) was associated with a significant 12% risk reduction in bone fractures of all types (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.95). When the trials reporting on BMD were considered (23 trials, 41,419 subjects), treatment with calcium (calcium supplement 500-1600 mg/d in addition to diet) or with calcium plus vitamin D (calcium supplement 200-1200 mg/d and vitamin D supplement 200-800 IU in addition to diet) was associated with a significant lower rate of bone loss at the hip (-0.54%, 95% CI - 0.35; -0.73%) and lumbar spine (-1.19%, 95% CI -0.76; –1.61%). A significant reduction in bone loss was observed in most of the individual studies considered. The reduction in fracture risk was significantly greater (by 24%) in trials reporting a compliance rate >80% (n = 8). The treatment effect was significantly greater in subjects with low dietary calcium intake (< 700mg/d), in subjects with low serum vitamin D concentrations (25-(OH)-vitamin D3 <25 nmol/L), in subjects receiving ≥ 1200 mg calcium/d, in subjects receiving ≥ 800IU of vitamin D (among those receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation). The effect was consistent irrespective of sex, fracture sites, or history of previous fracture. ",Tang et al.

Seven RCTs including 10,376 participants reported on the effects of vitamin D plus calcium versus placebo or no treatment. Pooled data from these trials showed a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of hip fracture (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.96) and in the incidence of non-vertebral fracture (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97).

(2007) was conducted with the aim of defining the need for additional calcium supplementation in individuals receiving vitamin D3 for the prevention of hip fractures (Biscoff-Ferrari et al., 2005). The meta-analysis included nine RCTs on the effects of vitamin D3 with or without calcium supplementation vs. placebo or no treatment in postmenopausal women and/or older men (over 50 years) specifically reporting on hip fracture risk. Based on four RCTs (9,083 patients), the pooled relative risk (RR) of hip fracture for subjects supplemented with vitamin D alone (400 IU/d in two trials, 700-800 IU in two trials) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.89-1.36, non significant compared to placebo/no treatment). In the six RCTs (45,509 subjects) that used supplementation with vitamin D3 (400 IU/d in one trial, 700-800 IU in five trials) in combination with calcium (500 mg/d in one trial, 1000 mg/d in three trials, 1200 mg/d in two trials), the pooled RR of hip fracture for the group supplemented with vitamin D3 and calcium was 0.82 (95% CI 0.71-0.94, statistically significant compared to placebo/no treatment). Measurement of BMD was not reported in the meta-analysis. The Panel notes that, although the target population, women, was not considered separately in any sub-group analysis, the majority of subjects included in the RCTs considered in the meta-analysis were women (from 62% to 85% of total subjects depending on the study).",Boonen et al.

This meta-analysis included 15 trials (1,806 subjects) published before 2000 that used calcium (≥ 400 mg/d), either alone or combined with vitamin D (≤400 IU/d – 2 studies) against placebo. The endpoints measured were BMD and incidence of fractures. Five of those studies (including 576 women) reported vertebral fractures as an outcome. The pooled RR indicated a non significant trend toward reduction in vertebral fractures in the calcium group (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.54–1.09, p = 0.14). The two trials that reported non-vertebral fractures had very few events, and the CI on the pooled estimate is very wide (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.43–1.72, p= 0.66). The impact of calcium on BMD at several sites was examined - total body (4 studies), lumbar spine at 2 years (9 studies), lumbar spine at 3 or 4 years (2 studies), hip (8 studies) and distal radius (6 studies). Calcium showed a statistically significant effect on BMD of about 1.6 – 2 % increase over 2 years at all sites except for the lumbar spine. The authors conclude that calcium supplementation has a relatively small, but possibly important effect on BMD in postmenopausal women. The weaknesses included large number of drop-outs during follow-up in most studies and the unexplained heterogeneity of results across studies.",Shea et al. (2002): 10.1210/er.2001-7002,"A more recent meta-analysis (Tang et al., 2007) included all the randomised trials in which calcium (or calcium plus vitamin D) was used to prevent bone loss and fracture. Trial quality was better in studies reporting fractures as outcome than BMD. In trials with BMD as outcome (24 trials), calcium supplements were associated with a reduced bone loss of 0.54 % (0.35–0.73; p<0.0001) at the hip and 1.19 % (0.76–1.61 %; p<0.0001) at the spine. The lowest supplement dose of calcium where a significantly positive effect on BMD was demonstrated was 500 mg and this finding was in women with very low habitual calcium intakes (50 % with mean intake of 279 mg/day and 50 % with mean intake of 522 mg/day) and who would therefore have a total minimum calcium intake of <779 mg (Dawson-Hughes et al., 1990). Fracture risk reduction was significantly greater (about 24 %) in trials in which the compliance rate was high (P<0.0001), in people >70 y old with a low body weight, with habitual calcium intake <700 mg/day, and in people living in institutions (Tang et al., 2007).

(20 g) vitamin D3 plus 1200 mg calcium (D + Ca) or 1200 mg calcium (Ca) daily. Women were followed-up for one year (uncontrolled) after the end of the intervention. A total of 145 women completed the intervention, whilst 67 women in the Ca and 70 women in the D + Ca group completed the one-year follow-up. [...] Both the intervention and control groups had higher serum 25(OH)D concentrations at the end of the eight-week intervention compared to baseline (baseline values for the D + Ca and Ca groups=25.65 12.14 nmol/L and 24.63 12.14 nmol/L, respectively), but these were significantly higher in the D + Ca group compared to the Ca group (increase from baseline=+40.46 27.01 nmol/L vs. +18.30 20.94 nmol/L; p=0.0001). Body sway saggital diameter was significantly reduced at 8 weeks in the D + Ca group compared to the Ca group (p=0.0435), whereas no significant differences between groups were observed in body sway frontal diameter or in body sway area.

Seventeen percent of subjects met the criteria for secondary hyperparathyroidism, namely increased intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels (iPTH 55 pg/ml) and normal serum calcium levels. At baseline there were no differences between the groups in the number of falls per person. A significant increase in serum 25(OH)D was observed in the D + Ca group [median interquartile range from 30.75 (23.0-55.0) nmol/L to 65.5 (49.75-82.75) nmol/L, +71 %] compared to the Ca group [from 29.0 (23.0-55.0) nmol/L to 28.5 (24.5-61.25), -4 %, p<0.0001).

These studies evaluated a total 3 066 births in the intervention and 3 039 births in the control groups, with 12 occurrences of NTD in the intervention and 45 occurrences in the control arms. Using a fixed effects model, the relative risk (RR) of NTD in the intervention arms was statistically significantly lower as compared to the control arms (mean RR 0.28 (95 % CI 0.15 to 0.52)).",De-Regil et al.

Estimates of the pooled treatment effect size and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using both fixed effect and random effects models. Overall, barley betaglucans lowered total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations by 0.30 mmol/L (95 % CI: 0.39 to 0.21, p<0.00001) and by 0.27 mmol/L (95 % CI: 0.34 to 0.20, p<0.00001), respectively. The ingestion of barley beta-glucans did not affect HDL-cholesterol concentrations. The cholesterol-lowering effect of beta-glucans from barley was apparently independent of baseline cholesterol concentrations, type of intervention and food matrix. High doses of barley beta-glucans (>7 g/day) did not appear to have a greater effect on blood cholesterol than modest consumption (3-5 g/day) (AbuMweis et al., 2010). ",AbuMweis et al.

Other blood lipid parameters (HDLcholesterol, triglycerides) were not affected. To address publication bias, visual inspection of funnel plots, Egger's weighted regression statistics, and the trim and fill method were applied. When potentially missing studies (i.e. unpublished negative studies) were taken into account, barley betaglucans still had a significant, albeit reduced, effect on total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations.",Talati et al.

In this randomised controlled cross-over trial, 24 mildly hypercholesterolaemic men (mean age 50.3±5.3 years) consumed a barley beta-glucan-enriched diet or a rice bran-enriched control diet for four weeks each (with a three-week wash-out in between) after a three-week run-in period on a Step 1 American Heart Association diet containing rice bran enriched foods (providing 19.7 g/day total dietary fibre, including 7 g/day soluble fibre). The barley beta-glucan diet provided 39.3 g/day total dietary fibre, of which 13.7 g/day was soluble fibre and 6 g/day of this was barley beta-glucans from a dry, processed, “high” (but undeclared) molecular weight concentrate included in various foods. The rice branenriched control diet provided 45.7 g/day total fibre, of which 10.4 g/day was soluble fibre.

In these studies, pH was measured in tooth biofilms in vivo after different types of sucrose challenges (rinsing, meal, and snacks) and with or without subsequent chewing of sugar-free gums. The pH was monitored using either the microelectrode method (Shu et al., 2007; Dong et al., 2003; Gopinath et al., 1997; Markovic et al., 1988; Abelson et al., 1990) or intra-orally mounted electrodes (Lee and Schachtele, 1992; Park 1990a, 1990b, 1993, 1995; Fröhlich et al., 1992; Maiwald et al., 1982; Jensen, 1986, 1988; Jensen and Wefel, 1989; Yankell and Emling, 1989) or unknown (Manning and Edgar,1993; Dodds et al., 1991). These two methods, with appropriate standardisation, have been determined to be equivalent by an expert body (ADA, 1985). The outcome measures varied, but most studies reported a rise in the minimum plaque pH (min pH) after a carbohydrate challenge when sugar-free gum was chewed in comparison to no gum, and/or a reduction in the area of the plaque pH,curve (AUC) below a fixed pH, such as resting pH, or a given value such as pH 5.5. Some studies reported pH curves only, with no numerical data. The 18 studies without exception demonstrated a rapid and sustained plaque acid neutralisation which occurred when sugar-free gum was chewed after an acid response to carbohydrate exposure. The effects did not differ for gums with different types of polyols, but protection was greater if chewing was introduced soon after sugar intake. Similar results were obtained in healthy adults (Shu et al., 2007; Dong et al., 2003; Abelson et al., 1990; Lee and Schachtele, 1992; Park 1990a, 1990b, 1993, 1995; Fröhlich et al., 1992; Maiwald et al., 1982; Jensen, 1986, 1988; Jensen and Wefel, 1989; Yankell and Emling, 1989; Manning and Edgar, 1993; Dodds et al., 1991) and children (Gopinath et al., 1997) and adults with reduced saliva secretion capacity (Markovic et al., 1988).

The serum 25(OH)D, or calcidiol, level is a good marker of status for vitamin D. Synthesis of vitamin D in the skin by the action of sunlight is insufficient to meet requirements in European countries, especially during winter months when there is little sunlight exposure. Adequate intake of vitamin D throughout childhood and adolescence is needed to achieve a vitamin D status that is sufficient for normal bone mineralisation and suboptimal vitamin D status has been shown to reduce bone mineral accretion in children and adolescents. Recommended intakes of vitamin D have been established for children and adolescents by several expert committees.

good consensus on the role of calcium in bone growth and development. It is well established that calcium is an important structural component of bone, and approximately 99% of total body calcium is found in the skeleton. Childhood and adolescence are periods of active bone growth and about 95% of bone acquisition appears to be completed by the age of 18 years. Adequate calcium intake throughout childhood and adolescence is needed to achieve maximum peak bone mass in young adulthood, which is an important determinant of bone mineral status in later life. The growth and development of bone is related to the quantity of calcium consumed and recommended intakes of calcium to meet requirements for growth and development of bone in children and adolescents have been established by various authorities.

Available evidence indicates that calcium intakes may be inadequate in sub-groups of children and adolescents in some EU countries, especially in girls (AAP, 1999; AFSSA, 2001; Branca, 1997; FAO/WHO, 2001; Gurr, 1999; JHCI, 2003; IoM, 1997, SCF, 2003)","AAP (1999): 10.1542/peds.104.5.1152; AFSSA (2001): 10.1051/rnd:2001100; Branca (1997): link; FAO/WHO (2001): link; Gurr (1999): ISBN 1-57881-052-3; JHCI, (2003): no ref; IoM (1997): 10.17226/5776; SCF (2003): link","The 18 RCT focused on the effect of increasing calcium intake (in addition to the usual diet) from supplements or foods on bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD), in children and adolescents aged 3-18 years (see reference list under individual studies). The studies are not entirely comparable because they involve children of different ages, with different habitual calcium intakes. Furthermore, subjects were given different amounts and forms of calcium and different bone sites were studied. A Cochrane review of these studies concluded that BMD generally increased with calcium supplementation. These increases were small and significant only for total body bone mineral content and upper limb BMD, not hip or spine BMD, and were most apparent in those on initial low calcium intakes. The increase in bone mass generally did not persist following withdrawal of supplementation. However, most of these studies were of relatively short duration (3 months to 2 years, maximum 7 years) and thus it was not possible to establish whether the temporary acceleration in bone mineral accretion with supplementation would result in increased peak bone mass at maturity if the higher level of calcium intake were maintained (Winzenberg et al., 2006a and 2006b). The other reviews of the intervention studies are in good agreement with these overall conclusions (Greer et al., 2006; Vatanparast et al., 2006; Wosje and Specker, 2000).",Winzenberg et al.

Both parents and assessors were unaware of the type of formula consumed by each participant. A total of 68 infants could be investigated at 34 weeks of age, and 61 at two years of age. From a control group of 63 breast-fed infants, 46 completed the trial until two years of age. There were no differences in visual evoked potential (VEP) acuity, which is used as an index of maturation of the retina and the visual cortex, between the formula groups at either 16 or 34 weeks of age. Breastfed infants had better VEP acuity at 34 weeks of age compared with all formula-fed infants, but not at 16 weeks.

Separate cohorts were used to assess electroretinography (ERG, 33 subjects) and visual evoked potential (VEP, 79 infants) for ethical reasons (to avoid infant overtesting). An additional group of term infants (n=29) exclusively breastfed for at least the first 17 weeks of life served as nonrandomised control group for blood fatty acid and VEP data. Major outcome measures included growth, blood fatty acid analyses (six, 17, 26, 52 weeks), VEPs analyses (six, 17, 26, 52 weeks) in the VEP arm only (Birch et al., 1998), and ERG responses (six, 17 weeks) in the ERG arm only (Hoffman et al., 2000). Sample sizes were based on power calculations considering sweep VEP acuity as primary outcome. Supplementation with infant formula containing either DHA or DHA plus ARA yielded better VEP acuity at six, 17, and 52 weeks of age but not at 26 weeks, when visual acuity development reaches a plateau. Infants receiving either enriched formula had more mature ERG responses at 6 weeks of age. Infants receiving the DHA formula had higher DHA and lower ARA levels in red blood cells (RBCs) compared to infants fed the DHA plus ARA formula. DHA (but not ARA) concentrations in RBCs at 17 weeks significantly correlated with visual function at 52 weeks in both studies. Fifty-two out of the 79 infants randomised to the VEP arm were re-evaluated at 4 years of age for visual acuity (Birch et al., 2007), which yielded significantly greater visual acuity in both the DHA and DHA plus ARA supplemented formula groups (with no significant differences between them) compared to the unsupplemented formula group. None of the supplemented formula groups had better visual acuity than the reference human milk-fed group.

Sample sizes were based on power calculations considering sweep VEP acuity as primary outcome. Sweep VEP acuity was assessed at six, 17, 39 and 52 weeks. Random dot stereo-acuity, blood lipid profiles, growth and tolerance were secondary outcomes. A total of 42 (DHA and ARA supplemented group) and 44 (control) infants completed the trial. VEP acuity was significantly better in the DHA and ARA group than in controls at all ages tested, while stereo-acuity was only better at age 17 weeks.
